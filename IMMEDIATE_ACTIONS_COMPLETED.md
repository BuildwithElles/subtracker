# - deploy.yml: Production deployment
# - maintenance.yml: Weekly security and dependency audits
```

## üîÆ Next Steps (Optional/Future)

### GitHub Actions Setup Required:
To activate the CI/CD pipeline, add these repository secrets:
```
VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret_here
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token_here
VERCEL_USER_ID=your_vercel_user_id_here
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id_here
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id_here
```

### Remaining Code Quality Improvements:
- Replace remaining `any` types with specific types (22 warnings - mostly event handlers)
- Add missing dependencies to React hooks (5 warnings)
- Most remaining warnings are in event handlers and error handling (non-critical)

### Optional Future Enhancements:
- Implement comprehensive unit tests
- Set up code coverage reporting  
- Add more specific types for complex event handlers
- Enhance error boundary implementations

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Configure repository secrets** for GitHub Actions
2. **Set up branch protection rules** for main branch
3. **Test CI/CD pipeline** with a sample pull request
4. **Add unit tests** when ready for comprehensive testing
